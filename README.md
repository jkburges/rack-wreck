# Wreck

Selectively cause requests to your rack app to fail - the idea being that by having an artifically flakey API, you are forced to build resilience in to your clients (Ã  la [Chaos Monkey](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey) from Netflix).

## Getting started

Install the [wreck](http://rubygems.org/gems/wreck) gem; or add it to your Gemfile with bundler:

```ruby
# In your Gemfile
gem 'wreck'
```
Tell your app to use the Rack::Attack middleware.
For Rails apps:

```ruby
# In config/application.rb
config.middleware.use Wreck::Wreck
```

Or for Rackup files:

```ruby
# In config.ru
require "wreck/wreck"
use Wreck::Wreck
```
